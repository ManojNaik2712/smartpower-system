## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

### 1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/ManojNaik2712/smartpower-system.git  
cd smartpower-system  

### 2. **Import as Maven Project**
- Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
- Import the project as a Maven multi-module project.

### 3. **Database Setup**
- Make sure MySQL is installed and running.
- Create the database:
   CREATE DATABASE smartpower;

### 4. **Run Microservices Individually**
  Each microservice has its own module:
- auth-service
- user-service
- payment-service
- notification-service

You can run each one using your IDE or via CLI:

cd auth-service

./mvnw spring-boot:run

Repeat this for each service.

### 5. **Access Swagger UI**
Swagger UI is enabled for each service:
- Auth Service: http://localhost:6001/swagger-ui/index.html

- User Service: http://localhost:6002/swagger-ui/index.html

- Payment Service: http://localhost:6003/swagger-ui/index.html
